In the emergency Pierre and Jacques, the waiters, take possession of the kitchen, and as there is quite a bit of jealousy between them, on account of the female waitresses who smile impartially on both. It is not long before the dough is flying. Meanwhile, the strikers have conspired. They drill a hole in a loaf of bread and insert therein a stick of dynamite, cleverly replacing the piece of crust on the end of the loaf. Then they give it to a little girl, instructing her to carry it to the bakery and explaining that because the bread is too heavy her mother has sent it back. The wife of Monsieur La Vie returns the child's money and orders are given to the bakers to put the loaf back in the oven and bake it some more. They comply. The whole establishment is in a demoralized state. Customers in the caf\u00e9 cannot get waited upon. The cook is in a towering temper. Pierre is clubbed on the head by the strikers, and goes about in a maudlin condition, getting himself and everybody else into all sorts of trouble. And then, the dynamited loaf explodes. The innocent victims are buried in splintered ovens, broken china an earthquake of pastry and bursting flour sacks, and huge mounds of dough heave fitfully where human hearts once throbbed. At the very end of the tragedy we see the yeasty mass churning and swelling, and then, out of the sticky lump, the unfortunate Pierre thrusts a gluey head.",

The last named falls in love with the old soldier's daughter. These leaders of the Texans successfully conceal their arms when Santa Anna issues a proclamation confiscating all weapons. With these arms the Texans attack the Alamo, a combined mission and fort, and capture it. Santa Anna, in whose absence they made their successful assault, starts back to San Antonio with 6,000 men. The Alamo is besieged and after ten days of fighting and desperate resistance, it is captured. Only Silent Smith, who had been sent to Sam Houston for help, Mrs. Dickinson and her baby and the old soldier's daughter are spared. Mother and child are sent to inform their countrymen of the fate that befell the rebels while the other woman is held by Santa Anna because of her beauty. Houston hears of the fate of the defenders of the Alamo when Mrs. Dickinson and her child ride into his camp. With his small force, Houston gave battle to Santa Anna's army on the San Jacinto river. The 6,000 Mexicans were routed by the few hundred Texans and Santa Anna was taken prisoner. He was released only after he agreed to grant the independence of Texas.",

But as he visits Sir George Carew one evening, his host criticizes him for his reluctance to experience the more sensual side of life. Sir George goads Jekyll into visiting a music hall, where he watches the alluring dancer Gina. Jekyll becomes fascinated with the two contrasting sides of human nature, and he becomes obsessed with the idea of separating them. After extensive work in his laboratory, he devises a formula that does indeed allow him to alternate between two completely different personalities, his own and that of a brutish, lascivious person whom he names Hyde. It is not long before the personality of Hyde begins to dominate Jekyll's affairs.",

Dancing in the square at the festival, Esmeralda is spotted by Jehan, the evil brother of the good archdeacon Claude Frollo. When he sets Quasimodo out to kidnap Esmeralda, Phoebus, Captain of the Guards, rescues her and captures Quasimodo. The courts sentence Quasimodo to be flogged, and the only one who will give him water while he is tied in the square is Esmeralda. After Clopin forces Esmeralda to leave Phoebus at the ball, she sends a note to Phoebus to meet her at Notre-Dame. In the garden, Phoebus is stabbed in the back by Jehan. Esmeralda is accused of stabbing Phoebus, convicted by the courts and sentenced to hang. When Esmeralda again rejects Jehan, he tells her that Phoebus is dead, even though it is not true. Clopin, Phoebus and Quasimodo all try different ways to save Esmeralda.",

Fran\u00e7ois grows up to be a renowned poet, an ardent patriot, and a notorious carouser who is not above criminal acts. During the revels of All Fools Day, he insults Duke Charles of Burgundy, for which King Louis XI, who is afraid of Charles, banishes Villon from Paris. In exile outside the city walls, Fran\u00e7ois looks for ways to protect France from Burgundy's plots. When Charles plans to have one of his associates marry the king's ward Charlotte, Villon successfully disrupts the engagement, but for so doing is sentenced to death. But Villon finds a way to exploit Louis' superstitious nature long enough to give him another chance to serve France, at the same time seeking the hand of Charlotte.",

Cardinal Richelieu sees the second son as a potential for revolution, and has him sent off to Spain to be raised in secret to ensure a peaceful future for France. Alas, keeping the secret means sending Constance, lover of D'Artagnan, off to a convent. D'Artagnan hears of this and rallies the Musketeers in a bid to rescue her. Unfortunately, Richelieu outsmarts the Musketeers and banishes them forever. Richelieu enlists D'Artagnan to look after and protect the young prince. Meanwhile, de Rochefort learns of the twins and Richelieu's plans, and kidnaps the twin, raising him in secret. Many years later, with Richelieu dead and the young prince crowned King Louis XIV, Rochefort launches his plan. The king is kidnapped, replaced with his twin, put in an iron mask so as not to be recognized, and led off to a remote castle to be held prisoner. Louis XIV is able to alert D'Artagnan, who realizes that only his friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis can help him, so he reunites the Musketeers to derail Rochefort's nefarious plot but at a heavy toll.",

He is mixed up in something with the local mob boss Josephus Martini. There is a shriek in the night; Adam Harker has fallen to his death from his penthouse. Police inspector Russell begins to suspect that Harker was pushed. He sees through Pat's cover as \"Miss Terry\", prying out of her a card she swiped from Harker bearing the image of a hissing snake and the words \"You will hear it\". Pat's rival reporter, Ted Rand, works for the Daily Express. He borrows a badge from his police friend Eddie, and gains access to the crime scene. He overhears Pat and Russell visiting, then phones the details of the case to his paper for an unethical scoop. Broken fingernails on Harker are consistent with scratches on a broken curtain rod in the apartment below his penthouse. The woman who lives there is dead, and her husband is missing. He is later found dead in the river. Harker's maid, Augusta, finds a secret compartment behind a bureau drawer while cleaning out the apartment. It is an anonymous threat to Harker for the role he played in the wrongful electrocution of Denny Fagan in prison. Pat and Ted now collaborate to gather further information on this case. Harker had been involved in placing blame on Denny for the murder of a Mr. Brinkman who had been applying heat on Harker. The apartment house janitor is behind all the murders. He is actually Denny's brother out for revenge. He uses gas to first subdue his victims.",

When Captain Pyke is shot, Holmes keys in on his mysterious Chinese widow as well as the shady Merrydew. Other members keep dying--Malcom Dearing first, then Mr. Baker. There is also an attempt on the life of young Eileen Forrester, who became a reluctant society member upon her father's death. Holmes' uncanny observations and insights are put to the test.",

Wayne is drawn into the fight through the encouragement of his new friends, and a call for help from an old friend, Armand Corday (Lon Chaney Jr.), who has been duped into The Devil's Circle, but is trying to break away.

To make the shooting seem less like an effort to suppress the investigation, it's made it look like the district attorney was keeping a jealous mistress. Andy Terrell, his wisecracking newspaperman friend, is networked with practically everyone and gets curious. Things get complicated for the utility company directors because Lionel Houston, now the new district attorney, is dating Diane Cromwell, the daughter of utility director Grover Cromwell. Andy uses his connections in low places to ferret out information but runs afoul of the king-pin Bruno by dallying with his lady. The utility directors were using their purloined funds to gamble in other stocks. Suddenly, they have no funds left plus cooked books. One tells Grover that he knows how to get his hands on $1M in gold bullion. He thinks he has talked Grover into fleeing with him, but Grover decides to arrange for a train/car accident so that his insurance will provide for his daughter. Lionel is lured by Bruno to a meeting but brings reinforcements.",

Maxwell's gift of impersonation gets him and Meirschultz past the guards and into a morgue where they use a special serum to revive the corpse of a pretty young woman. But that's nothing. Dr. Meirschultz has a heart beating in a jar of solution and is eager to put it into a corpse that really needs it. Meirschultz gives his assistant a gun and advises him to commit suicide so that he can put the heart in him, but Maxwell shoots and kills the scientist instead and hides the body. People will miss Meirschultz, Maxwell quickly realizes, but no one will miss his lowly assistant; so Maxwell dons eyeglasses and a fake beard to become his onetime benefactor. The trouble is, he impersonates the mad doctor too well and goes crazy himself.",

His replacement, Captain Downey, takes over the liner just as it is about to be used for an experiment in remote control. Professor Grimson has devised a system for controlling the ship from a laboratory on land. But as Grimson demonstrates the system and the special component that makes it work, a rival group is listening in, hoping to use the device for its own purposes. Shortly after the demonstration, the professor is attacked and fatally injured. Major Pope comes on board to investigate the attack, and he decides to come along on the planned trip. Soon the ship is full of passengers and crew--and at least two of the ship's occupants are really enemy agents.",

With current champion Al McSwatt needing an easy opponent, Walsh gets Joe the fight. Palooka steals the championship (and girlfriend Nina Madero) from McSwatt, who shows up for the fight drunk. Now it's Joe's turn to live in the fast lane, winning fights (that are set-ups by Walsh) and drinking hard with vamp Nina. However, when McSwatt and his manager trick Joe into a rematch, it's time to test his real boxing talent.",

But the gang attacks the pair, and Bly joins them in the gunfight. Bly is wounded and is taken to a Mexican's camp to recover. He gives John his badge and authorizes him to take up the hunt. The Kid, unknown to John by sight, is on a ranch which he hopes to gain legal possession of as it has oil. It is really John's by right, which he does not know until informed by his sweetheart, Joan Vallon (Roberta Gale.) The Kid has taken a letter from the stage holdup which he is using to establish his identity as the rightful owner named Everett Tarkington Clark, John's real name. John is in the courtroom when the Kid makes his claim, but his protest is overruled and he is arrested on suspicion of having killed Marshal Bly. He and Bootch escape and ride to intercept the Kid who is on his way to eliminate Bly, the only person that can verify John's claim...",

He discovers that the source is in central Africa and, backed by the nations of the world, sets out on an expedition. Bruce learns that the disturbances emanate from an area called the Magnetic Mountain. But unknown to our hero and his pal Jerry, the Magnetic Mountain also contains a super-advanced secret city ruled by the tyrannical scientific wizard named Zolok, who has unleashed the electrical fury threatening civilization as part of his plan to conquer the world. Zolok has under his control a brilliant inventor, Manyus, Manyus' beautiful daughter Natcha and an army of giant African slaves, who follow the dictates of a strongman, Appolyn, and Gorza, a dwarf. Also in the mix are schemers Reynolds and Colton, who plan to capture Manyus and thereby gain control of Zolok's army, and a double-crossing fellow explorer named Butterfield. Can Bruce evade Zolok's \"destroying rays\" and stop his dreams of world conquest?",

    "plot outline": "The Green Goddess is a totem worshiped by the primitive natives of a lost city deep in the jungles of Guatemala. It contains both a fortune in jewels and an ancient formula for a super-explosive which could threaten world safety in the wrong hands. From Africa, Major Martling and Ula Vale launch separate expeditions to find the Goddess and place its secrets in safe hands. Ula's fiance died in an earlier attempt at the same goal and she has taken up the trail in his memory against the advice of her lawyer, Hiram Powers, who covets the Goddess for himself and sends Raglan, a mercenary, to get it for him. Aboard their ship to Guatemala is Lord Greystoke - aka Tarzan - on a mission to find his old friend, d'Arnot, whose plane crashed in the vicinity of the same lost city. Tarzan joins forces with Martling, and they reach the lost city in time to save d'Arnot, but lose the Goddess to Raglan. Ula joins Tarzan and Martling in pursuit of Raglan, whence they must contend with the perils of the jungle, Raglan's henchmen, and a party of primitives from the lost city sent to retrieve the Goddess...",

His children, upon learning of his misfortune, immediately desert him knowing he will no longer provide them with money. So Adolph Greig sinks lower and lower and becomes a street beggar, too proud to ask for help from his friends and unable to find his son or daughter. One night, standing in front of the concert hall, he sinks to the street from hunger and fatigue. He is picked up by two men associated with the orchestra, Mancini and Rozzini, and they take him to Rozzini's and they develop a plan whereby they will set up Greig in a next-door studio where he can give violin lessons. A young violin genius named Carl Rupert shows up and, with the aid of Mancini and Rozzini, Greig starts the boy off on a brilliant career. Or, what promised to be a brilliant career until his long-lost mother shows up.",

Spike, the stranger, is interested in Molly other than for her pretty face; he is a member of a gang of jewel thieves who are planning to rob Abrams and want to use her to obtain information regarding the merchant's shipments of jewels. Through another ruse, gang member Flash Ackroyd gets the information and, through careful planning, frames Terry for the robbery. One of Abrams' assistants is killed and Terry is charged with robbery and murder. Terry escapes but Molly is fired as Abrams thinks she was in on the robbery. Molly gets a job in a nightclub run by the gangsters. The train on which Terry is escaping is wrecked and he is transported to a hospital more dead than alive.",

As the priest,in his prison cell, is preparing to burn the parchment containing the location of the secret formula, Colonel Mazovia kills the priest and takes the partially-burned parchment. Fade to after the war to an expedition of representatives from all the Allied countries (only those with colonial interests it appears) being sent to Cambodia to find and destroy forever the Secret of the Zombies. The group includes Colonel Mazovia (somewhat akin to sending the fox to guard the hen house); a student of dead languages, Armand Louque; Englishman Clifford Grayson; and General Duval and his daughter Claire. Armand falls in love with Claire, who accepts his proposal of marriage in order to spite Clifford whom she really loves. Later, when Claire, following an accident, runs to Cliff for comfort, Armand breaks the engagement, leaving her free to marry Cliff. Further accidents, caused by Mazovia, results in the natives refusing to work and the expedition returns to Pnom Penh. Armand fins a clue which he had overlooked before and returns to Angkor against orders. After viewing an ancient ceremony at the temple, Armand follows one of the servants of the high priest out of the temple, through a swamp, to a bronze doorway. When the servant leaves, Armand goes through the door to a room paneled in bronze, with an idol holding a gong in one hand in the middle of the room. He accidentally strikes the gong, and a panel in the wall opens revealing a small metal tablet. He translates the inscription and realizes that it is the secret for which they have all been looking. He alone now has the power to make zombies out of people, beginning with a practice run on his servant before taking up that little matter of the fickle Claire. Armand is not one to be trifled with.",

    "plot outline": "For Tex Ritter's first starring film Producer Edward Finney and director J.P.McCarthy chose to do a remake of a 1930's \"Oklahoma Cyclone\" which McCarthy had directed and Wellyn Totman wrote. McCarthy brought Totman's original along, Robert Tansey adapted it and he and McCarthy shared story and screenplay credit, and Finney added ex-outlaw Al Jennings name to it for whatever value it may have added. (\"Very little\" Finney wrote in a 1976 letter.) The story differs little (since \"Oklahoma Cyclone\" also had several songs, including the mincing \"He a Lavender Cowboy\" which died a quick deserved death in the first version) in that a young U.S.Deputy Marshal (Tex Ritter) hunting for his missing father, poses as a wanted outlaw and is chased by a posse into the rancho hacienda of Don Estaban Valle (Martin Garralaga) where he takes refuge in the bedroom of Lolita Valle (Joan Woodbury), the Don's daughter. She hides him from the searching sheriff (Monte Blue) and Evans (Ted Adams) the manager of her father's mining properties. Evans knows he is hiding there but does not tell the sheriff as he has use for an outlaw. All of the ranch hands are members of the gang Evans has put together to acquire mines by any method, unknown to Don Valle, and Evans hires Tex to become part of the gang. But Tex sings a couple of songs that disgust head henchie Cherokee (Warner Richmond), who thinks he is a \"sissy\" but Lolita thinks otherwise and in very impressed and taken with Tex. Evans is also displeased as he has designs on Lolita himself, and tells Cherokee to get rid of Tex in a rigged gunfight, but Tex, with the help of good-bad guy Slim Zoni (Fuzzy Knight) prevails.To prove he is what he says he is, Evans directs Tex to kill a couple of miners, Norman Conklin (Bob Burns) and Bill Henderson (Tex Phelps), and Tex apparently does. Later, Don Valle is murdered and Tex is framed for it and jailed. Evans is directing Tex's trial and rolling right along until Tex's lawyer (Robert Fiske) calls two surprise witnesses...the two miners Tex was supposed to have killed. Tex discloses his real identity to the Sheriff and Evans sees his game is up. There is a shootout in the courtroom and good-guy comic relief Zoni dies (just as his character in the original film played by Al St. John did also) by a bullet from Evans' gun before Tex shoots Evans. Ritter sings \"My Sweet Chiquita\", which he wrote and also his own arrangements of \"Rye Whiskey\" and \"Sam Hall\" He also sung \"Out on the Lone Prairie\" which was written by and credited to Harry \"Shorty\" Miller but some sources incorrectly show Ritter as the composer. And leading lady Joan Woodbury sang her own composition called \"You Are Reality.\" Jose Pachea and His Continental Orchestra provided some fiesta dance music.",

This war drags out over many decades until most of the people still alive (mostly those born after the war started) do not even know who started it or why. Nothing is being manufactured at all any more and society has broken down into primitive localized communities. In 1966 a great plague wipes out most of what people are left but small numbers still survive. One day a strange aircraft lands at one of these communities and its pilot tells of an organization which is rebuilding civilization and slowly moving across the world re-civilizing these groups of survivors. Great reconstruction takes place over the next few decades and society is once again great and strong. The world's population is now living in underground cities. In the year 2035, on the eve of man's first flight to the moon, a popular uprising against progress (which some people claim has caused the wars of the past) gains support and becomes violent.",

Pat returns to the post with the prisoner while Gale resumes his journey with the Raven's documents and identity. Gale contacts tavern owner McClain, suspected of being mixed up in the wholesale fur thefts, and convinces him that he is actually the Raven masquerading as a Mountie. McClain discloses some of the secrets of the operation but will not tell Gale the name of the ring leader. Gale meets Reynolds and Foster, the rival trappers who are accusing each other, and attempts to restore peace between them Reynolds is shot and wounded and Gale meets Ruth, his daughter, and falls in love with her. Gale learns that a fur buyer is at Twin Oaks and has just made a deal for ll of Reynolds' pelts. Foster, certain those are the pelts recently stolen from his warehouse goes to Twin Oaks and confirms his suspicions. Gale finds out that McClain has been stealing furs from both trappers, thus inciting both men into the present feud. Gale brings them together. Dr. Martin, Twin Oaks only physician, discovers Foster and Reynolds discussing McClain and speculating who the higher-up can be. It be him and he shoots both men. The wounded trappers are found by Gale, who also finds a string of wild doves recently killed by a hunter and some empty cartridges. He traces the evidence to Dr. Martin and rides to town to arrest him. But he is met by McClain and his men, who challenge his identity as the Raven. He hides outside his cabin and arrest McClain and his men when they show up to kill him. Pretending to be wounded, Gale stumbles into Martin's office and finds the gun which was used to shoot the two trappers. Dr. Martin and McClain are sent to the Mountie headquarters, while Gale remains behind to claim Ruth for his bride.",

    "plot outline": "\"Shadows of the Orient\" was originally (and still is) a Larry Darmour production made under the Empire Films banner in 1935 and released in August of 1935, although Motion Picture Herald did not review it until February of 1936. Following the reorganization of Monogram, after W. Ray Johnston, Scott R. Dunlap, Trem Carr and Paul Malvern broke away from their short stay at Republic Pictures, Monogram was in need of product to fill their exhibitor committments and picked up the film from whatever state-rights limbo it was in, and sent it back out on August 13, 1937 under a Monogram Pictures logo with nothing to indicate it was a re-issue of a two year-old film. Its first New York showing was at the Central Theatre on October 11, 1937, 27 months after initial release through the Empire exchanges, and it had lost three minutes from its original 68 minutes. The Foreword tells it all: \"Since the passing of the Oriental Exclusion Act the smuggling of aliens has been constant. Although the smuggling is less than a few years ago, when Chinese were brought into the United States from Mexico in carlots, the traffic has by no means ceased, according to immigration officials. The length of the frontier and sparsely settled regions makes patrolling impossible. These smugglers have no regard for human life and resort to any means to accomplish their selfish ends. The boss of the ring, at this time, is receiving fifteen hundred dollars per head on safe delivery.\" This film's late 1937 \"re-issue\" release by Monogram may well be the reason that Esther Ralston used the name of Jane Carleton when she appeared in Universal's \"Spy Ring\" which was filmed in late 1937. The foreword is quite possibly the only time that the border connecting Mexico with Texas, New Mexico, California and Arizona was referred to as a frontier in the 20th century.",

In limbo because they've never done either good or bad deeds, they decide to try a good one now: rehabilitating Topper. Lovely, flirtatious Marion takes a keen personal interest in the job. Will Topper survive the wrath of jealous ghost George? Will Mrs. Topper find that a scandalous husband isn't all bad?",

The Cardinal also warns de Berault that dueling has been outlawed, and will henceforth be punishable by death. Gil, however, promptly disobeys the law and is indeed sentenced to death. The Cardinal offers to cancel the sentence if de Berault is able to capture the duke who is organizing plans for an uprising. Gil travels to the duke's castle and is allowed to stay as a guest, but the duke's wife and sister immediately suspect that he is a spy. He and his servant still make good progress, until he falls in love with the duke's sister, which complicates everything.",

The selfish young couple agree that even if they spend ten years in prison, it will not matter because they will have the money when they are released. During what appears to be a normal transaction, Jimmy gives Ruth $100,000 that he has taken from the vault, and after they hide the money in a music box, which they mail to Ruth's Uncle Billy for safekeeping, they turn themselves in. Mike Roberts, a detective for the bank's insurance company, tries to convince them to lighten their sentence by returning the money, but they consider the money rightfully theirs and refuse. The judge hearing their case is dismayed by their lack of repentance, and sentences them to one-to-ten years without parole. Jimmy and Ruth are then sent to separate prisons, but communicate by notes. Jimmy's tough cellmate, Blackie Clayton, tries to find out where the money is hidden, but Jimmy gives him misleading information. Sometime later, Roberts arranges for Jimmy and Ruth's paroles and attaches special stipulations that he hopes will make them go straight. The couple are paroled under the conditions that they have no civil rights and cannot marry for eight years. They are crushed by the conditions, but will not give in when Roberts tells them they will be free if they return the money. They try to retrieve the music box from Uncle Billy, but they discover that he has died and that his possessions are to be auctioned. They go to the auction, where they are outbid by auction aficionado Victor J. Holbrook, after which they go to Holbrook's apartment and explain that they need the box. Holbrook tells them he has already sent the box to his aunt, Martha Foster, and when Ruth and Jimmy return to their boardinghouse, they find Blackie waiting for them. He orders them to cut him in on the stolen money, but when Roberts appears, Blackie sneaks out after stealing their money and car. Jimmy and Ruth hop a train to Sunnydale, where Martha lives, and although they are detained by sheriff Ira Foster, Martha's husband, until they show their parole papers, they find Martha's guest farm, check in and locate the music box. After dinner, Roberts, alerted by Ira, shows up to warn Jimmy and Ruth that Blackie is close on their trail. Later that night, Blackie threatens Ruth that he will kill Jimmy unless she gives him the money. Jimmy and Ruth attempt to elude Blackie, but he soon catches up with them and fights with Jimmy. Ruth knocks Blackie out with the music box, after which Roberts appears on the scene. The beleaguered young couple give Roberts the money and determine to live an honest life, in which they will earn their happiness instead of stealing it.",

The killer makes off with their prize possession, a synthetic diamond, made by a secret process by Professor Bernard Goodman , the father of their good friend Gwen Longworth. A guest, Sir Raymond Blantyre, head of the Metropolitan Diamond Syndicate, disappears at the same time, and Drummond suspects that Sir Raymond, who has the most to lose if Professor Goodman proceeds with his plans to publish his secret process, has something to do with the theft. He leaves Phyllis and chases back to England. Colonel Nielsen, of Scotland Yard, as usual scoffs at Drummond's suspicions and insists that a man as respected as Sir Raymond could not possibly be involved in such a crime. But, as usual, he has Drummond followed just in the event he turns up something unexpected. An explosion that wrecks Goodman's house, and apparently kills him, makes Drummond more positive that the diamond king has again resorted to murder to protect his business. He follows Professor Botulian, a life-long rival of Goodman's, whom he believes to be involved in the affair. His hunt leads him to a lonely house on the outskirts of London where he finds Goodman a prisoner. Before they can escape, Drummond and Goodman are joined by Tenny (E. E. Clive), his valet, and Phyllis, who are also (as usual) being held by the crooks. Faced by Blantyne and his armed confederates, Drummond begins to fight his way out, but is met by superior forces.",

Years later, the five of them make a practice of meeting once a year. Marty, the one who had been caught, now runs a night club and gambling house, while Helen is a singer who performs there. Jerry is now a priest, while the two O'Mara brothers have become policemen. On the night of their reunion, the O'Mara brothers are called to investigate the death of one of Marty's customers. Marty knows that two of his enforcers are responsible, so he sends them back to cover up the evidence. But one of the O'Mara brothers confronts them, with violent results that will set the former friends against one another.",

Marshall, a New York talent scout, makes an offer to Ethel as a single and, to induce her to take it, Duke writes a fake check, made out to him, for $5000 pretending he has sold his contract with Ethel to Marshall. Resentful and heartbroken, she accepts and becomes a big hit in New York. Marshall then books her at the swanky Century Club, plans her show himself, and it flops miserably. Meanwhile, Duke has used his last resources to start a new show, but without Ethel it also fails. He joins the Doc Dorando medicine show, and with him as the speiler for the quack elixir sold by Dorando, it is successful. He becomes Doc's partner with an elaborate trailer and a company of entertainers, including Willie Covans, the Basin Street Boys, The Cats and the Fiddle, \"Rubberneck\" Holmes and Joe Stevenson. Money is rolling in but he drops everything to hurry to Ethel's side when he hears of her misfortune. Ella, Ethel's faithful companion and maid, has also told Ethel of Duke's sacrifice in order to give her a chance in New York. Duke talks the Century Club owner, Fenton, into allowing him to build an elaborate show based on a medicine show concept, and sends for Doc Dorando and the other entertainers.",

Barclay suggests that McGinty marry her, thereby giving her his American citizenship. A Chinese friend sends the bride a beautiful mandarin figure, to be used as an incense burner but Johnny decides to use it as a hiding place for the amulet. Barclay learns that the marriage does not make Irene an American citizen, but he obtains a Chinese special passport and the three friends, after beating off another attack by the Sargoza gang, reach the Japanese merchant ship that is to take then to safety. On ship they encounter Fuji Yokahama who has learned the hiding place of the amulet.",

Caught in a course-altering storm, a crash-landing destroys the plane, kills the plane's officers, and tosses the surviving passengers into the sea. They are washed ashore on an isolated island inhabited solely by mysteriously reclusive Mr. Taylor and his servant, Ping. Until Taylor decides if, how and when he will allow them to take his boat back to China for help, this disparate band must work together, change their self-centered ways, and examine their motives for wanting to escape from the island and their pasts.",

    "plot outline": "Madame Helene Smith operates a swanky salon for renovations of women's faces and bodies, with her partner Mazie Mason who grew up with Helene on New York's not-so-swank Tenth Avenue. Mazie is in love with newspaper columnist Terry Kent, who frequents the place for juicy items as the salon is a gathering place for the town's rich and near-rich ladies. Terry calls it a \"scandal house\" and, if he had known the title would be changed to \"Slander House\" before release, would have deemed it as such. Upper-crust Doctor Herbert Stallings, with mandatory pencil mustache, is in love with Helene, who isn't all that taken with him. Enter Ruth DeMilo, statuesque showgirl and gold-digger de luxe, quickly followed by Pat Fenton, dashing young man-about-town, who sees and quickly falls in love with Helene, despite the fact she uses Madame as a title. He takes her to a cabaret where she is insulted by Fenton's attorney, George Horton, who tells her that Fenton, the cad, has hired him to check her background. Fenton decks Horton in the ensuing brawl, and Helene, mortified and somewhat hacked, exits alone. Mazie makes Terry keep the brawl story out of his paper, but the other papers use the story and the fact that Horton was involved. Mrs. Horton, an obese middle-aged woman who has let herself go to pot over the years and has been trying to regain a measure of her former looks and figure at Helene's salon, is furious over the news, especially the news that Ruth DeMilo was also involved. Helene placates her by saying the Fenton is engaged to Miss DeMilo, and that her husband was merely keeping a business appointment, although in reality DeMilo is Horton's on-the-side sweetie. Still miffed at Pat, Helene accepts Dr. Stallings' always-standing offer to become engaged. In trying to avoid Fenton, whom she really loves, Helene inadvertently jumps in Horton's car, who, evidently always in the market for on-the-side sweeties, tries to make love to her, and there is a car wreck, with both Horton and Helene escaping uninjured. This second escapade involving Helene and her husband makes Mrs. Horton convinced that the two are having an affair and, in utter despair (it says here), she tries to commit suicide by gulping down a bottle of hair dye. Dr. Stallings pronounces her condition grave, and Pat,urged by Helene, brings her husband to her bedside, where a tender reconciliation between the ever-ready Horton and his stand-by-her-man wife takes place.",

He had been there assisting Major Martling and Ula Vale in their quest for the Green Goddess, a totem worshipped by a primitive jungle tribe inside of which was hidden a formula for a super-explosive. They had successfully wrestled this totem from the natives and were heading back to Livingston when they were attacked by Raglan, a thug sent to steal the Green Goddess and its formula for Hiram Powers' personal use, and the Goddess is seized from them. On the trail of Raglan, they had to deal with his henchmen and also a party of the primitives, sent by the High Priest to retrieve the Goddess. With the Goddess still in Raglan's hands, they were seized by the natives and Tarzan locked in a small cell with a loosely-tethered lion, Ula in an adjacent cell under guard from a hideous jungle hag, and Martling being forced to watch his bumbling valet, George, being tortured by the natives with the assistance of a nameless expatriate white scientist who had joined forces with the primitives...",

When the firm's boss McNeil (Holmes Herbert) learns that Johnny has embezzled some money, he fires him and has him jailed.

He climbs up the outside of his home and pins a note to this effect on housemaid Kitty. Stevens makes a call about an outstanding $250K loan, insisting he has a plan for its repayment. His plan includes his niece, Norma Denby, who is co-beneficiary with him on her father's estate. He invites her along with her fianc\u00e9, Jack Marsden, to visit. Rather than call the police, Stevens has hired an inept trio of detectives to provide protection. A second note comes: The Gorilla will strike \"At midnight\". To further confuse things, there is a real gorilla in a cage in the garage. Someone releases it wander around the premises. As midnight approaches, the radio suddenly comes to life and says, \"five minutes\" and then \"one minute\". Stevens disappears when the lights go out. The maid spots a hairy arm sticking out of a closet door. When it is opened, an unconscious stranger falls out. Another stranger, well dressed in dark attire, sneaks in, searching Steven's desk and hidden safe. A new message declares, \"The Gorilla has done his work. Walter is dead. He's in the garage.\" Kitty is trapped in the gorilla cage and the gorilla, whose name is Poe, has grabbed a fainted Norma. The darkly dressed man claims to be a securities investigator. But he's really \"The Gorilla\". Peters, the butler, surprises him from behind. Stevens set the whole thing up to catch The Gorilla who was preying on his clients.",

    "plot outline": "\"The Phantom Creeps\" was Universal's 44th sound-era serial (between \"The Oregon Trail\" and \"The Green Hornet\") and was re-issued to theaters in 1949 by Commonwealth Pictures Corporation, a distribution set-up handling primarily Universal re-issues. Commonwealth had no hand at all in the production of this serial (as incorrectly shown on site) as they were a distribution company only. Some sources mistakenly identify them as the serial producer because all of the 1949 re-issue prints (and the 16mm prints sold to television circa 1952) show \"Commonwealth Pictures Corp. Presents\" above the title.There is a whole lot of difference between \"presenting\" and \"producing\", a fact that some sources appear to not know or don't care. The serial is of interest to some collectors as it re-unites Bela Lugosi and Edward Van Sloan from 1931's \"Dracula\", and the crater-discovery of the meteorite fragment by Zorka in the serial is stock footage from Universal's 1936 \"The Invisible Ray.\" The stock footage of an explosion and avalanche used in Chapter 11 comes from Universal's 1934 serial, \"The Vanishing Shadow.\" Plot finds eccentric scientist Dr. Alex Zorka carrying on various experiments in his secret laboratory with the aid of his assistant Monk. Zorka has invented many strange weapons of warfare, including a devisualizer belt which renders him invisible; a terrifying, eight-foot tall robot (played by stuntman Edwin \"Bud\" Wolfe and not circus giant Bud Wolff), and he also has a deadly meteorite fragment (which he found in a 1936 movie with Boris Karloff) from which he extracts an element which can induce suspended animation in an entire army. Foreign spies, operating under the guise of a foreign language school (great cover), are trying to buy or (mostly) steal the meteorite element, while his former partner, Dr. Fred Mallory, miffed that Zorka will not turn his inventions over to the U.S. Government, blows the whistle on him to Captain Bob West of the Military Intelligence Department. Tired of answering the door and saying no to the spies and the government, Zorka moves his lab and when his beloved wife is killed, Zorka, puttering around for his own amusement up to this point, gets hacked off as only Lugosi can, swears eternal vengeance against society, and decides to use his inventions to make himself world dictator. And would have if not for his assistant Monk, an escaped convict virtually enslaved by Zorka, who is cowardly, treacherous and totally incompetent, and whose accidental or deliberate interference with Zorka's efforts repeatedly frustrates his master's grand schemes.",

    "plot outline": "A southpaw with a distinctive boxing style, New York based Johnnie Bradfield has just won the world boxing champion title. While he, to the public, portrays himself as wholesome, doting on his mother, he, in reality, lives a hard and fast life in stark contrast to that public persona. While passed out in a drunken stupor, a reporter, poised to expose Johnnie's true lifestyle, dies in Johnnie's apartment. Knowing that he did not kill the reporter but that he is implicated in doing so, Johnnie, with a few hundred dollars of his several thousand dollars amassed wealth in his pocket, goes on the run in learning that the authorities also believe that he died in a fiery car crash. Not by plan or choice but rather circumstance and need, Johnnie, using the alias Jack Dorney, ends up at the Rafferty Date Farm in Arizona run by elderly, widowed Grandma Rafferty, whose husband, before his passing, took in a group of six reform school kids from New York City to give them a better chance at life in that reform. Despite initial animosity between Johnnie and Grandma, the six reformees and Peggy, the sister of one of the reform kids who accompanied her brother to the farm in feeling she may be a grounding influence for him, all end up having a reciprocal positive influence on the other, especially Johnnie and Peggy, who start to fall for each other. There are two problems potentially to upset Johnnie's new life. First, he may turn to the only way he knows how to earn a living, namely boxing, which may expose him as still being alive. Second, NYPD Detective Monty Phelan, whose career took a nosedive ten years prior in a grave error of judgment, believes Johnnie is indeed alive and will do anything to prove his case in needing to restore some legitimacy to his career.",

    "plot outline": "Roy Rogers (Roy Rogers, and not playing \"himself\" but playing a character named Roy Rogers), posing as The Carson City Kid, is seeking vengeance on Morgan Reynolds, the man who killed his brother. To find Reynolds in the gold towns, he systematically stops stagecoaches and goes through the mail, hoping to find letters addressed to Reynolds and thusly learn his whereabouts. Thus \"The Kid\" earns the reputation of a stagecoach robber, although he never takes anything, and the reputation is enhanced by the fact that he travels with Laramie (Francis McDonald), a notorious half-breed outlaw. A posse is about to capture them and Roy rides back to get Laramie whose horse has been shot, and Laramie repays the favor by slugging Roy and escaping on his horse Trigger. The posse rides by the unseen Roy and captures Laramie and, since he is riding the \"Kid's\" horse, take him to jail as being the \"Kid.\" Laramie denies this and is told he will be free when he identifies the \"Kid\"; othewise he will hang. Roy rides into town, having deduced that the Morgan Reynolds he is looking for operates the Yellowback Saloon under the alias of \"Lee Jessup\" (Bob Steele) . As part of his plan to get evidence against Jessup, who also does not know his true identity, Roy takes a job as saloon shotgun guard, and meets saloon singer Joby Madison (Pauline Moore, in one of the truly great performances found in the B-western genre) and falls in love with her. This doesn't set well with Jessup, as he has plans of his own regarding Joby. Young gold miner Scott Warren (Noah Beery, Jr.), having hit his strike and heading for home with his fortune, comes into the Yellowback, talks too much about his stake, and is soon relieved of it in a crooked poker game by Jessup and friends. Scott, realizing he had been cheated, breaks into Jessup's office and, announcing he is the Carson City Kid, holds up Jessup henchman Harmon (Hal Taliaferro) and takes his gold and some letters and papers from the safe. Captured, he is taken before Laramie, who quickly identifies him as the \"Kid\" although he has never seen him before, in order to win the immunity promised him. Roy, masked as the Carson City Kid and speaking Spanish as the Kid did on the stage holdups, intervenes and at gunpoint, asks Jessup to identify what Scott has stolen from him. Besides the gold, Jessup unwittingly identifies as his own the latters and documents, which establish him as Morgan Reynolds. Reynolds meets justice and Roy is exonerated. ne fine little B-western with an excellent performance by George \"Gabby\" Hayes (as Sheriff Gabby Whittaker), before he had the character down as a sleep-walking exercise and was still revolving, and by, as mentioned, Pauline Moore, as a no-excuses heroine for being where she was doing what she did as a saloon entertainer.",

The sailor, not knowing anything about the boy, thinks he'll be more successful hitchhiking alone back to his ship. It's the boy who has the idea of pretending to be the sailor's kid, jumping into his arms, pretending to be a sick kid, prompting a well-meaning woman to pick them both up. The boy continues to pretend that the sailor is his dad, causing many problems for the sailor when everyone believes the boy, and doesn't believe the sailor. The movie continues, sometimes humorously, and often dramatically, as the main characters continue to grow closer together, becoming the family that they were not, before. An enjoyable diversion for a weekday afternoon (I'm watching it on FETV).",

The director's secretary asks the train's engineer, an old boyfriend, for help. As the engineer ponders what to do, a stranger in the train station tells him that he has a baby that could be used. On board the train, the actress meets a young doctor whom she knew in school, and whom she is still in love with. The presence of the baby causes a series of misunderstandings between them, but the real problems begin when the engineer begins to suspect that the baby may have been kidnapped.",

    "plot outline": "Pilot James \"Mac\" McCarthy goes off-course somewhere between Cuba and Puerto Rico and is unable to pick up any radio transmissions. When he and his passengers, Bill Summers and his Black valet Jefferson Jackson, hear a lone transmission in a foreign language, they crash-land the plane on the island below. The lost men find themselves in a graveyard, and follow the sound of drums to a nearby mansion. There they are greeted by Viennese Dr. Sangre, who treats Mac's minor head wound with the warning that untreated injuries are easy prey for evil spirits. Sangre says there are no radios on the island and allows the men to spend the night as his guests, although he insists that Jeff stay in the servants quarters in the basement. Jeff becomes alarmed when the maid, Samantha, and the cook, Tahama, call forth two \"zombies,\" but when he runs upstairs to tell his boss, Sangre dismisses the idea as ludicrous. Sangre's wife Alyce also appears to be in a trance-like state, which Sangre attributes to jungle fever. Sangre appears surprised when Bill tells him about American Admiral Wainwright, whose plane disappeared in the same location. Sangre then tells the men that no one in his family, which includes his beautiful niece, Barbara Winslow, can leave the island because they are Austrian refugees lacking passports. Later that night, Jeff confides in Samantha that Bill is a government agent on a secret mission. Sangre's butler, Momba, Samantha and Tahama leave Jeff alone in the kitchen just before midnight, with the admonition not to pay notice to anything unusual. When two zombies nearly attack Jeff, he runs to Bill and Mac's room for safety. Jeff is later awakened by the appearance of a woman who seems to come and go through a wall, and when he awakens Bill and Mac, they believe him only after finding an earring. The three men split up to search the house, and Bill finds Barbara in the library reading a book on hypnotism. Barbara says that she is reading the book to help her aunt, who has been in the trance-like state since arriving at the island, and Bill confides his belief that Sangre is hiding a radio. Bill and Mac finally believe Jeff's stories about zombies after Mac is attacked by one. The next morning, Mac and Bill discover a freshly dug grave in the cemetery, and that someone has stolen the plane's radio. Mac goes in search of a generator, while Bill returns to the house, unaware that the admiral is being held hostage in a cellar and that Tahama is trying to pry military secrets from him with the use of voodoo. After Sangre calls in a report to his German allies, Mac disappears. Sangre then lures Jeff into the cellar, where he hypnotizes him into believing that he is a zombie. While Bill is searching for Mac, he finds Barbara using hypnotism on her aunt, and assumes that she is collaborating with Sangre, despite her protests that she is trying to restore her aunt's memory. Mac returns in a zombie-like state, and a physician called by Sangre says that he has been dead for hours. When Momba receives orders by radio for Sangre to transmit the stolen military information, he and Tahama prepare a special ceremony to wrest the information from the admiral. Jeff lines up with the other zombies for dinner, but Samantha breaks his spell. Jeff then meets with Bill and moments later, they hear a woman's scream and find Alyce dead. Bill and Jeff follow the sound of drums into the cellar, where Sangre is holding a ceremony during which the admiral's thoughts are to be transmitted into Barbara's brain. Bill breaks up the ceremony and when Sangre orders the zombies to attack Bill, they instead follow Mac, and turn on Sangre. Sangre shoots Mac and, while backing away from the zombies, falls to his death into a firepit. After Wainwright phones the Coast Guard, and Mac's injuries are treated, Wainwright tells Bill that Sangre forced his plane to land with a false radio signal, then killed his crew and tortured him for Canal Zone fortification plans. When his torture did not work, he used Alyce and Barbara as test subjects with other methods.",

    "plot outline": "Danny, managing boxer Muggs, books him into a Civilian Conservation Corps camp for training. Muggs' arrogant manner soon alienates him from the other boys who downright ostracize him with a camp-wide silent treatment after Muggs' public display of bad sportsmanship in a camp boxing match. One of the few boys still willing to talk to him is Willie, a cowardly and manipulative sort, who privately admits he stole $100 from the Captain's safe to send to his aunt and begs Muggs for help. In Muggs' world you aid a friend in trouble, so he enters a city boxing tournament to earn replacement money for Willie. Willie, however, allows Muggs to get caught trying to replace the money. Muggs stoically takes the rap for stealing, but Danny, a true and observant friend, knows something's up and clears Muggs by capturing and beating a confession out of Willie. The Captain leaves Muggs with the lesson that ratting out a friend is sometimes the right thing to do.",

    "plot outline": "First of all this film was produced and distributed in 1938, and is not a 1941 production. The exhibitors and various censor boards objected to the original title, \"The Sunset Strip Case\" (because of the double meaning that implied a strip on Sunset rather than the name of the street, which is exactly what the producer had in mind when he hired fan-dancer Sally Rand, the hit of the Chicago Exposition and the later Texas Centennial), and Boston promptly banned the film, as Boston was often subject to do with far less reason than they had with this film. The film was tied up in law suits across the country brought against the various blue-nose boards who also blocked its showing, and all this was going on during the collapse of Grand National with GN president E. W. Hammons being hauled to court by exhibitors and creditors, including the production unit headed by this film's producer George A. Hirliman. The latter produced it for Grand National distribution, but Grand National had no distribution left when Hirliman finally got it cleared for showing in New York in 1941 under the title of \"The Sunset Murder Case\"...and it was distributed through indie exchanges in 1941 as Grand National had long folded its tent. It still carried the Grand National logo, which evidently has fooled the source that keeps calling this a 1941 production, and showing it as being distributed by an entity that no longer existed. The cast order shown on the 1941 prints is no way reflective of the cast order shown on original release. Excuse the use of Plot Summary to explain why this is not a 1941 film, but that is beginning to appear to be the only way to get this film into its proper decade. The plot summary, albeit skimpy, already on site will suffice for the plot. Be advised that Sally Rand was slower with her fans and showed more flesh in a later-Soundies short film than she does here. This one ran into trouble in 1938 because of her name and not what she actually showed, although she showed more than was custom in 1938...or 1948 or 1958 for that matter.",

Edward thinks his father left him a legitimate business, and that he is running an actual insurance company. Rogers tells the gang members that \"Baby Face\" Morgan is now in charge, is a cold-blooded killer and does not even want the gang members to know him. Joe Torelli, who thinks he should be the leader of the gang, is suspicious and grows more so after the protection collection money starts to roll in, and nobody sees the money after it is turned over to Rogers, who tells them that \"Baby Face\" is handling the dough. Complications arise when Edward/\"Baby Face\" meets Virginia Clark , head of a transportation company, who has had a truck wrecked when she wouldn't pay the protection money. Edward writes her an insurance policy and promptly pays off when a second truck is wrecked. This starts a rash of business to Acme, and as fast as the gang shakes down trucking companies and wrecks their trucks, Edward pays the merchants on their policies, and this puts a serious dent into the gang's cash flow. Torelli learns that Edward is \"Baby Face\". So Torelli kidnaps Edward's sweetheart Virginia.",

    "plot outline": "A Universal Army enlistment promotion, produced as a musical showcase for Harry James, the Andrews Sisters, Joe E. Lewis, and Donald O'Connor & Peggy Ryan. The film's thin plot has James drafted, and joining him is the band's lead vocalist Lon Prentice (Dick Foran), who doesn't believe that Army training and regulations are necessary for anyone of his skill and fame. Shemp Howard steals the film whenever James and the Andrewses aren't performing. As Sgt. Snavely, he's effectively teamed with Mary Wickes as his shrewish fianc\u00e9e, trying desperately to keep her away from the attentions of nightclub comic and USO performer Lancelot Pringle McBiff (Joe E. Lewis). Shemp also has the opportunity to clown onstage with the Andrews Sisters during a musical finale, as they perform Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree. Arguably, Shemp's best solo feature film credit.",

The Range Busters, Dusty, Davy and Alibi, are selected to take the horses there but, before leaving, they capture three spies who are trying to steal the horses and also learn that the ranch cook, Cookie, is a Japanese spy, but he manages to escape. In the Philippines, they go to a caf\u00e9 for dinner and see Cookie and Miller, a German spy. Eavesdropping, they learn that Ken Richards, a neighboring Texas rancher, is the Axis contact back in the states. They capture Cookie and break up the spy ring in the Phillipines, and then return to Texas intent on settling matters with Richards. They do so and are honored by the U.S. Government just as the radio blares forth the December 7, 1941 announcement of the Pearl Harbor bombing. They head for the nearest enlistment station.",

Despite having no experience as a spy, he is asked by his superiors, because of his academic background as a chemical engineer and being fluent in Romanian and German, to lead a spy mission deep in Nazi occupied territory. The Nazis have near perfected a formula for a new poisonous gas to use in chemical warfare, his mission to infiltrate the gas plant near Pilsen in Czechoslovakia where it is being mass produced, steal the formula to bring back to Britain, and blow up the plant before the Nazis are able to distribute the gas for their war effort. He is to assume the identity of chemical engineer Jan Tartu of the Romanian Iron Guard, the real Tartu who the Nazis are unaware has been killed. To carry out his mission, Stevenson will require the assistance of the underground in Czechoslovakia, he given the name of a contact through which he is to work. Stevenson's path into Pilsen is not a completely problem-free one, he needing to improvise, most specifically in the means to contact the underground. In this light, he has to learn who he can and cannot trust, especially among those with who he is assigned to live: Anna and Paula Palacek, the owner of the rooming house and her daughter who works at the gas plant; Otto Vogel, an inspector the Nazis have assigned to be his guide; and Maruschuka Lanova, a beautiful young woman who has a sense of entitlement and who uses her feminine wiles to get what she wants, most specifically from Nazi officers such as Vogel who is in love with her. Conversely, those secretly working for the Allied cause may have to figure out on their own if their intuition tells them that \"Tartu\" is really on their side.",

    "plot outline": "In the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, director Gregg Toland is tasked by producer John Ford, both now serving in the navy, to film a documentary about that infamous day. What Toland provided was an 82 minute documentary that featured not only the attack but focused heavily on the local Japanese population's supposedly large role as spies providing information to the homeland. Ford took over the direction of the film and the military eventually released a 34 minute version focusing on the attack. The longer version features Uncle Sam telling the audience how naive America was before Pearl Harbor with recreations of Japanese people collecting information in preparation for the attack.",

Doc is trailing his stolen horse, and it is discovered in the possession of Billy the Kid. In a surprising turnaround, Billy and Doc become friends. This causes the friendship between Doc and Pat to cool. The odd relationship between Doc and Billy grows stranger when Doc hides Billy at his girl, Rio's, place after Billy is shot. She falls for Billy, although he treats her very badly. Interaction between these four is played out against an Indian attack before a final showdown reduces the group's number.",

The logging company she inherited is doing poorly, but Elaine gets an order in for a huge shipment of lumber. Russ and his friend Squirrel volunteer to help her cut the timber for the shipment, along with her friends Smacksie Golden and his girlfriend Lil Boggs, who are not used to doing physical labor. Russ pilots the plane to deliver the lumber before the company falls to a slimy businessman. An under-rated, highly enjoyable film with a great cast and witty dialogue.",

Recipients become hideously deformed. After noting that famed concert pianist Anthony Lawrence's daughter Patricia strongly resembles his dead wife, he becomes obsessed with winning her favor. She already has a serious boyfriend, Bob Blake, who is also Lawrence's tour manager. Patricia rejects Markoff's advances. Still unwilling to give up, Markoff manages to injects her father with his acromegaly serum. Anthony's fingers start deforming such that he can no longer play and his face begins to grow distorted. In return for the antidote, Markoff intends to extort a fortune and demand the hand of the musician's pretty daughter. Markoff's long-time female assistant, Maxine, has secretly harbored a love for him for years. She is most distressed when she overhears of his intentions. So are Patricia and her boyfriend.",

Eddie is agreeable to having his soul transferred to the judge's body, as it will give him a chance to avenge himself on his killer. But every action taken by Eddie (as the judge) results in good rather than evil and, to Nick's dismay, the reputation and influence of the judge is enhanced, rather than impaired by Eddie. And Eddie also falls in love with the judge's fianc\u00e9e, Barbara. Even Eddie's planned revenge fails and Nick is forced to concede defeat. He returns to Hell, taking Eddie with him, after Eddie has extracted his promise that Nick will not molest the judge or Barbara in the future.",

Stinky is an avid collector of music boxes and has several quite expensive pieces in his vast collection. The previous night, someone broke into his flat and knocked him unconscious when he tried to intervene. All they took however was a simple wooden music box he had bought at auction that day for a mere \u00a32. The box was one of three available for sale and as Holmes and Watson begin to trace the other purchasers, it becomes apparent that someone will stop at nothing, including murder, to retrieve all three. When Holmes learns the identity of the music box maker, he is convinced it contains directions to the retrieval of something very valuable that the government has kept from the public.",

Jack Haley is a producer with only half-rights to the program while Ozzie Nelson and Helen Walker are the radio writers and supply the romance. Rudy Vallee, always able to burlesque himself intentional and, quite often, unintentional, is the owner of the sought-after sponsoring company. Frances Langford, as herself, sings \"I'm in the Mood for Love\" while the Vagabonds quartet (billed 12th and last) chimes in on \"Angeline\" and \"The Old Square Dance is Back Again.\"",

    "plot outline": "The film begins on Mother's Day 1938 when 14-year-old Ziggy Brennan (Mona Freeman) buys a gardenia for her mother. Ziggy's youthful exuberance disappears when she enters their apartment and finds her mother Natalie (June Duprez) drinking with a strange man. Natalie introduces Ziggy as her \"sister\" and quietly cautions Ziggy against calling her \"mother.\" Later, dispensing some motherly advice, Natalie tells Ziggy that if she learns all the tricks, she'll never need to work for a living. Ziggy goes right out and applies parts of this advice by stealing a valuable lapel pin from a fellow high-school student, and is promptly expelled from school. About five years later, Ziggy has made progress and meets Denny Reagan (James Dunn), who persuades her to go into his racket. Ziggy's role is to telephone people who are planning to move and make arrangements to provide a truck to move the furniture. The departing truck is the last that the owners see of their furniture as it is taken to a warehouse and sold by Denny and his gang. Hanging out in a nightclub one evening, circa 1943, the still-underage Ziggy flirts with a young naval officer from Minnesota, Mart Neilson (William Marshall), who promptly falls in love with her and proposes marriage. To ensure that Mart knows her background, Ziggy introduces him to Natalie (at her worst), but Mart still insists on the marriage. Shortly after the wedding ceremony, Mart is shipped out to war-duty and is killed in action. Ziggy learns that she is expecting a baby, while the law catches up to Denny and ships him out to prison. Ziggy is still living with her mother but Natalie, horrified at the prospect of being a grandmother, kicks her out and Ziggy moves into Mrs. Merryman's (Rosalind Ivan) boardinghouse. Ziggy has the baby and some time passes, circa 1944-45, and Ziggy--still making her nightclub rounds--runs into the just-paroled Denny. This Denny is a new-and-thoughtful version, and he does not approve of Ziggy leaving her baby with a sitter while she makes her rounds. Denny shows great interest in the baby and sees more and more of Ziggy. Returning from a date, Ziggy finds the baby's crib vacant. In her absence the babysitter had gone out to her boyfriend's car for some heavy necking and the baby had almost choked to death before being discovered by Mrs. Merryman, who promptly called the police. At the trial, the babysitter denies responsibility (negligence-of-duty) and Ziggy loses custody of her baby. The new-and-thoughtful Denny will have nothing to do with Ziggy, although his mother, knowing that Denny and Ziggy really love each other, tries to bring them together--but Ziggy has disappeared. Having moved to another boardinghouse, she drops by a church and finds an abandoned baby. Denny finds her and the baby sunning in a park and is impressed and thinks she's become the perfect mother. With Denny's help, Ziggy appeals her case to regain custody of her own child, and when the judge learns that she has been caring for an abandoned baby, he is much impressed and returns her own infant to her.",

Evans asks Thomas and his daughter Penelope to drive him into town in their wagon in order to send an urgent telegram. The telegram contains a land claim and is sent to the land recorder's office. The Quaker family is ignoring the town doctor's advice to rid themselves of the gunfighter and they compassionately tend to the delirious Evans.

Claghorn was a blustery, one-man-Chamber-of-Commerce for all things Southern, who had no tolerence for anything north of the Mason-Dixon line, although he made allowances for South Philly. The character inspired the creation of one of the most popular of the Warners' cartoon characters, Foghorn Leghorn, who re-worked most of the originals material and style. The title of this movie is a stock line- \"it's a joke, son\"---he would feed a befuddled Fred Allen each week. In the film, Claghorn gets into some financial difficulties and is forced by a machine-political gang to enter a race for state senator against his wife (Una Merkel) who appears to have a good chance to beat the political hack backed by the machine. Claghorn is in to siphon votes and ensure his wife's opponent will win and is expected to run a campaign that will defeat himself and his wife. But, he runs to win and the machine's henchies abduct him.",

During the flight, the colonel breaks away from his guards, causes the plane to go out of control, and it crashes into the sea. The survivors get into a rubber boat and go through a minor-league version of \"Lifeboat, with no Alfred Hitchcock sightings, until Air-Sea Rescue pilot Jim Willis rides to the rescue.",

    "plot outline": "The \"spoilers\" in this Republic programmer are headed by unscrupulous salmon fisherman Matt Garraway (Paul Kelly). Treating women and competitors with equal contempt, Garraway charms and abandons such lovelies as Laura Reed (Evelyn Ankers) and Jane Koster (Adrian Booth). Having persuaded Laura to put up money for his fish cannery, Garraway drops her like a bad habit and begins pursuing Jane, so that she'll recruit her Indian friends to do some off-season salmon fishing. Jane's brother Pete (Francis McDonald) figures out long before anyone else does that Garraway is a no-good, and he sets the wheels in motion for the villain's ultimate downfall. Even if the opening credits had been removed, audiences would have known that Spoilers of the North was a Republic picture when Roy Barcroft showed up as Greenaway's chief henchman.",

    "plot outline": "The war in Europe is over, the Japanese are about to surrender after the Nagasaki bombing, but a group of die-hard German Nazis are holding on in Shanghai, protecting an ingenious invention of mass destruction - a cosmic ray generator that is 1000 times more deadly than the A-bomb. Col. Von Meyer is about to pass the secret of the weapon to Col. Noyoma, as Japan is still at war, and will use it to revenge their recent losses. However, Field Marshal Von Runzel arrives with precise orders to the contrary: the Japanese shall not have the secret weapon, for an underground Nazi ring is to use it later in another attempt to destroy all the Allied Nations, and conquer the world in a third Worl War. Von Meyer decides to create a diversion, and to offer the Japanese scientist and officers some \"evening entertainment\" at the German Officers' Club. Thaler, the female German Officer, is to bring in a number of women - arrested on trumped up charges at the Shanghai University - dress them up, and force them to service the lusty Japanese officers. First, he asks for volunteers, but only the French entertainer Yvette comes forward. The other five women (American, English, Austalian, Russian and Mexican) stubbornly refuse. Then he shouts at them: \"I say, naturally you'll all volunteer!\" The 16-year-old Australian girl finds her mother as a hard-laborer at the club, they rejoice for a while, but knowing that her pure catholic girl will be ravished that night, Mrs. James kills her daughter instead. Her absence will not be missed much, as two other young women arrive, a Chinese and a Japanese. Soon, the Germans are about to betray the Japanese, but the American is in cahoots with an infiltrated German officer who's really her husband (an OSS spy), the Chinese is trying to make the others believe that Maya is an infiltrated Japanese agent, while Lili herself is seeing a Chinese servant of the Germans in secret, and the women are justly suspicious of Yvette - who is getting fond of the bald-head Colonel Von Meyer... In the end, the American plot is uncovered, the Germans and the Japanese start killing each others, and the fugitive American and Chinese spies. A number of people die in heroic gun-fights. Maya is going to defuse the bombs left in the wine cellar by the escaping Americans, so that the Japanese will get the secret weapon in the end. However Yvette decides to change her loyalty to her country, thinking of what the English girl told her. The two women clash in a desperate fight all over the place, as the fuse is burning - with the future of humankind at stake.",

The stars in her eyes fade when she finds she is to work in his apartment, with a constant parade of eccentric visitors and slapstick provided by klutzy roommate Ronnie. Moreover, Waterbury's idea of work looks a lot like play, his interest less in books than in blondes. She leaves; to get her back, he swallows his playboy principles and marries her. Can the leopard change his spots? Can Stephanie turn the tables?",

Soon they're off to New York together, but part ways once they arrive. Time passes and Eddie is failing to sell his play; Perry is failing to find a job. Odd circumstances, involving an old pickpocket named Mandy, bring them together again. Three starchy sisters renting a room, a bartender named Mike, and a sleepy old immigrant running a mechanical menagerie all play parts in this romantic comedy.",

His beloved wife Irene tells him that she is not feeling well enough to travel with him and asks him to give a lift to her cousin Jim Torrance. On the highway, Jim--who is actually Irene's lover--tries to kill Walter, hitting his head and throwing him off a cliff, and has a fatal fiery accident while escaping driving Walter's car. Walter is believed to be the driver and later his wife is sent to jail accused of plotting his murder. Meanwhile, the wounded Walter falls asleep in a moving van and eventually winds up in Larkspur, a small town in Idaho. He is hired as a mechanic in a gas station by the owner, Marsha Peters. For three months Walter reads the news, expecting revenge with Irene sentenced to death, and he and Marsha fall in love with each other. When Walter discloses the truth to Marsha, she convinces him to return to San Francisco and save his unfaithful wife. The situation changes when Irene accuses him of plotting to kill her lover Jim, and Walter must prove his innocence.",

Actually, Bill Wright (Damian O'Flynn), Mitchell's associate, killed Carter because the ranger had discovered tussock moth infestation in the forest, and if the infestation was not reported, the trees would die and have to be cut, thereby profiting Mitchell and Wright. In order to compensate the best he can, Gene sells his sportsman's camp and gives the money to Carter's daughter Helen (Patricia Barryas Patricia White) . En route to Texas, Gene discovers the infestation and is assigned by the Forest Department to supervise the program of spraying the area with DDT from the air. After the first day of spraying, the DDT is blamed by furious stock men for the many animals found dead of poisoning. Gene suspects a strange plane heard flying in the night was responsible. Gene's friend Joe Lucas ('Jimmy Lloyd'), after quarreling with Gene, is suspected of flying the phantom plane to discredit Gene's spraying program. The innocent Joe discovers the plane hidden at Mitchell's Mill and is shot by Wright. Gene heads for a mountain cabin to confront Mitchell who is waiting to kill him. Joe flies to warn Gene of the trap but Wright is also in the plane.",

Maria protests by slapping the face of Reyes, (the first of many times) and he is so enthralled by her spirit that he immediately declares she must become his wife. In response, she shows some more spirit, she sets off a firecracker under his horse. Reyes begins to soften and, with the aid of Father Sierra and Maria, who is about to marry her local suitor, he helps the town fight an influenza epidemic. He decides to retreat than stage a battle in the town against the advancing government troops. Maria is so stirred by the bugles of the retreating rebels, that she leaves her marriage ceremony and marches with Reyes and his ragged army across the desert into the sunset.

When they get the news everyone except Stanley is overjoyed. His wife and grandmother-to-be Ellie (Joan Bennett) broadcasts it everywhere and all Stan can do is worry about the practical things like how his son-in-law Buckley Dunstan (Don Taylor) can afford it. Well, having not long ago paid for the wedding, Stanley has no intention of bearing any of the expenses involved. Buckley's parents and Ellie are overjoyed at the news and virtually take over redecorating the young couple's new house. Crisis and false alarms take over their lives and when the child is born, the only person he doesn't seem to like is Stanley. A walk in the park - and absolute panic when Stanley misplaces his grandson - seems to resolve the situation.",

When funding falls through, independently rich adventurer Wright Thompson underwrites the project under the condition that he be allowed to go. As the group goes deeper beneath the Earth's crust, personalities clash, tempers flare, and the dangerous journey claims the lives of several expedition members. When they come upon an enormous underground expanse with its own ocean and phosphorescent light, it appears that their goal has been achieved.",

He finds that rancher Artemus Taylor, an arthritic despot, and his henchies, Sam Tobin and Cree, are forcing out the settlers in order to claim their land for the incoming railroad. The plot nearly predates \"The Great Train Robbery\" in age, but the gritty execution, and well-acted performances, take it out of the norm, way out, in a couple of instances. Brassy Myrna Dell is on hand as Taylor's independent daughter, only slightly less meaner than her father, and the always welcome Dorothy Malone is the pretty school marm on the side of good. Ireland's passive outlook on life changes before the end.",

Through his delirium he recalls his one true love, Cynthia Green, whom he lost by his obsession for roaming the world in search of stories for his novels. Though she is dead, Cynthia continues to haunt Street's thoughts. Despite one successful novel after another, Street feels he has compromised his talent to ensure the success of his books, making him a failure in his eyes. His neglected wife Helen tends to his wounds, listens to his ranting, endures his talk of lost loves, and tries to restore in him the will to fight his illness until help arrives. Her devotion to him makes him finally realize that he is not a failure. With his realization of a chance for love and happiness with Helen, he regains his will to live.",

The work is carried out in remote, underground labs located on the Zarpa Mesa in the Mexican desert. He wants to create a master race of hybrid superwomen and spiders through his procedures. He invites Dr. Leland Masterton, a famous entomological scientist, to see his creations. Masterton is horrified and subsequently becomes the next candidate for experimentation. The techniques work better on females than males. Masterton is released and is quickly institutionalized. More outsiders become involved with Dr. Aranya when a plane carrying the wealthy financier, Jan van Croft, and his bride to be, Doreen Culbertson, crashes on the mesa. Also aboard is Masterton, who has forced the pilot to fly the plane despite it being in need of engine repairs. The survivors are captured in hopes of using them for additional experiments. Masterton is determined to put an end to the experimentation. He mixes an explosive concoction and sends the pilot and Doreen down a side passage to escape. They get picked up by an oil company surveyor as they are about to perish of thirst and heat exposure.",

When their lead guide, Subra, learns his wife has been kidnapped by a Yeti, Parrish disbelieves him, so the sherpas commandeer the expedition at gunpoint and turn it into a search-and-rescue party. To Parrish's surprise, they discover a whole family of Yetis in a cave, and are able to subdue the male and carry it back to civilization, to ship to the USA for study. Subra is forgiven his acts because he was right after all. Wells, meanwhile, phones in the story and Parrish finds his discovery - shipped upright in a meat cooler to maintain its natural environment - detained in the US because Wells' story refers to it as a snowMAN, and a decision must be made whether this is a customs or immigration matter. During this bureaucratic snafu, the creature escapes its containers and disappears into Los Angeles, mysteriously appearing in different parts of the city. Parrish teams up with police Lt. Dunbar to find the creature, which kills anyone who stands in his way...",

He continually annoys her with his narrow-minded remarks, yet she takes the pictures he requests of a local fiesta, and later she convinces a plantation owner from the area to be their guide. As they begin the trip in search of the archaeologist's goal, he begins to respect the young photographer. But as both he and their guide become increasingly attracted to her, tensions begin to build, even as they face ever-increasing dangers.",

The agents steal Reg's boat, stranding the teens on the island. The four friends are then held captive in cages able only to speculate on their fate.

The American pilot John MacLeran is selected from three finalists to be the pilot. The rocket climbs into Earth orbit just fine, but in trying to leave from there toward the moon, the rocket becomes unstable. He has to abort the mission and return in his passenger capsule. The balance of the atomic rocket keeps going and explodes in the Delta asteroid cluster. The detonation dislodges a group of asteroids from their orbits. they coalesce into a cluster and begin hurtling on a collision course with Earth. Scientists determine that in passing the moon, gravitational disruption will cause tidal waves. Military teams everywhere are trying to evacuate coastal residents to higher ground. At the last minute, MacLaren suggests that all Earth nations who belong to the nuclear club, fire their missiles into the meteor cluster. One scientist, convinced the looming disaster is a divine punishment for playing with nuclear energy, tries to prevent crucial trajectory calculations for the missiles being completed.",

    "plot outline": "This classical peplum tells a fictitious story set in 490 BC, the time of the Medic Wars during which Persian armies sweep the Ancient world. Having brought home to Athens the Olympic victor's laurel crown, Philippides joins as commander the Sacred Guard, which is expected to defend the city-state's liberty, a year after the chasing of the tyrant Hippias. Athenian supporters of Hippias conspire, hoping to side Philippides by marriage to Theocrites' expensive servant Charis, and thus neutralize the guard. She fails to seduce him, as his heart is already taken by a young girl before the learns her name is Andromeda, daughter of Creuso. Everything personal is likely to be put on hold when the news breaks that the Persian King of kings Darius's vast army is marching on Greece, hoping its internal division will make its conquest a walk-over. Theocrites reproaches Miltiades to hold back the sacred guard to defend the Pallas temple after a likely defeat, and proposes instead to negotiate terms with Darius, but is told an alliance with Sparta could save the Hellenic nation. Philippides makes the journey and survives a fiendish attempt on his life by conspirators; he returns with Sparta's engagement during the Persian attack in far greater numbers on Militiades valiant troops. Charis, left for dead after overhearing Darius's orders, reaches the camp to tell that the Persian fleet, now commanded by traitor Theocrites, is heading for Piraeus to take Athens. Miltiades sends Philippides ahead to hold out with the sacred guard until his hopefully victorious troops arrive, and after his perilous journey back they do a great job, proving superior athletes can do better then traditional naval ramming tactics ...",

Mushnick agrees to give Seymour another chance, and the next day Seymour brings in Audrey Jr., which becomes Mushnick's pride and joy and draws interest from his other employee Audrey Fulquard and more and more of their clients. Suddenly the plant ails, and Seymour accidentally learns that she likes blood. Upset because he doesn't know how to feed her, he walks along the railroad track and throws a stone that accidentally hits the head of a man who falls on the track and a train runs over him. Seymour takes pieces of the body back to the shop and discovers that the plant likes human flesh. The next morning, Audrey Jr. has grown and become the attraction of the shop. But how will Seymour feed his plant again?",

Once, he finds himself in a life threatening situation, and is saved by a strong man, Maciste. In another occasion, he sees a beautiful girl, Nofret, and falls in love with her. He talks with his father the Pharaoh Amirteo I, about being much impressed with the hunger and miserable living conditions of the people. His father decides to raise an army against the Persians, but his beautiful but cunning wife Smedes, godmother of Kenamon and allied of the Persian Gran Visir, kills him before he acts. Once on the throne of Pharaoh, Kenamon is drugged with a substance prepared by Smedes, and loses his will-power. Meanwhile, Nofret is about to be sold as slave. Maciste becomes the leader of the people's revolt, and is acclaimed at the the local games. Maciste gets Nofret free, manages not to fall under Smedes' love filters, and gathers and leads a rebellious army against the Persian troops and the palatial guard. The Grand Visir and Smedes are killed and thus Kenamon is free from his stupor. Kenamon thanks Maciste for his decisive help, and married Nofret at last.",

In return for his devotion, these gods reward him with Immortality during his fights against any mortals. For this, Goliath is respected and admired by friends and foes alike. However, King Eurystheus who is a Tyrant, does not believe in Goliath's immortality and plans to slay him and conquer his native land, The Kingdom of Thebes. For this purpose, Eurystheus steals the precious Blood Diamond belonging to the God of Vengeance and hides it in the Cave of Horrors where a Cerberus and a Dragon guard it. Goliath vows to return the diamond to the God of Vengeance. In Goliath's absence, Eurystheus plans to invade and conquer Thebes. If the plan to send Goliath to his death in the Cave of Horrors doesn't succeed, King Eurystheus' back-up plan is to pit Goliath against his brother Hyllus. Eurystheus intends to convince the jealous Hyllus that his girlfriend Thea secretly loves Goliath, despite the fact that Goliath is married to Dejanira. Eurystheus also plans to have Goliath poisoned by employing the services of his house slave Alcinoe. Finally, Eurystheus has no qualms about using Dejanira as a hostage against the vengeance of Goliath.",

She becomes an easy mark for a pseudo-scientist, Eric Zinthrop, who claims to have developed a serum from the enzymes of wasps that will turn aging skin to youthful-looking skin. The second-best thing to a time machine. She, without any hesitation, agrees to be the first human to try the Zinthro injections. But, as her beauty returns, her secretary, Mary Dennison, and her advertising executive, Bill Lane, notices she is also having a personality change and it isn't for the better, albeit she was no Miss Congegeniality to begin with. Then, Zinthrop gets hit by an automobile, for plot-development purposes, and is somewhat incapacitated and not in any shape to be whipping up any new batches of Zinthrop's Wasp Enzyme Injection Serum and, without her enzyme injections, Janice turns into a wasp-like woman and meaner that a yellow-jacket hornet. Several people don't live to regret coming into contact with her, and this is not good for the business, either.",

    "plot outline": "This story opens with John Bradford throwing a graduation party for his son, Jim, who has just earned a degree in engineering. John has planned to make his son a partner in his engineering firm for many years. However, Jim has decided to enter the ministry. He is hesitant to tell his father because he knows his father will be upset. After he tells his father his intentions, his father does all that he can to try to dissuade him from going. But Jim does go away to seminary. Alice, who is John's secretary, has been dating Jim for years. She continues to write him while he attends four years of seminary. When he completes his classes he applies for foreign service and is assigned duty in New Guinea. He has a hard time telling Alice his plans because it would mean that she would have to go with him if they get married. Jim explains that while he was a soldier in WWII he realized that there were millions of impoverished people throughout the world that didn't know about Jesus Christ and he felt he was called to help teach them about Jesus. Jim flies to New Guinea and one day he sends a telegram asking Alice to marry him. Alice flies to New Guinea and joins Jim. They get married and have two children, a boy and a girl. But then Jim catches a life threatening disease. Jim's parents, John and Dora Bradford, fly to New Guinea. After a few days Jim dies. He has kept a journal which he gives to his father before he dies. Alice and the children return to live with Jim's parents. John reads Jim's diary over and over trying to find comfort. He wonders why Jim had to die if he was doing so much good. After reading Jim's journal over and over and pondering Jim's life, John decides that maybe he has been to lax in his devotion to his religious beliefs. He decides he wants to serve like Jim did, but not in the exact same way. Instead, he travels around the US speaking to congregations encouraging them to become involved in the missionary works all over the world by sending missionaries to impoverished areas and supporting them financially. The film ends with John completing one of his speeches about how important it is for people to be actively involved in being a disciple of Christ.",

Vercingetorix has rallied many tribes to his cause, including one led by the beautiful Queen Asterix and others who'd once pledged allegiance to Rome. At first things go badly for the Romans, complicated by the fact that Vercingetorix has captured and tortured a centurion named Claudius Valerius who's in love with Caesar's ward, Publia, who has also fallen into the hands of Vercingetorix. Eventually a great battle pitting Caesar against the rebellious Gaul decides the fate of all concerned.",

He is wandering near the coast when he sees a young woman (Sandra Knight) and asks her for directions to Coldon, where he hopes to rejoin his regiment. But the woman doesn't answer, doesn't even greet him and walks away. Eventually she takes him towards the sea, where she disappears in rough water. Andre loses consciousness while trying to follow her, and is attacked by a bird and awakes in a house where an old woman (Dorothy Neumann) claims never to have seen the woman. After he leaves, he sees the woman again, and while trying to follow her, is saved by a man from certain death. Andre learns that in order to help the girl, he must go to castle of Baron Von Leppe (Boris Karloff), and when he arrives, Andre sees the woman looking out of a window. However, Baron Von Leppe is old and seems reluctant to let Andre in. He claims there's no woman in the castle, but shows Andre a painting which does indeed portray her. Andre learns that she is the Baroness, who died twenty years ago. What is the baron's secret?",

Though victorious at the tournament, Ursus is arrested and forced to turn a grist-mill under an overseer's lash. Meanwhile, the former king's virtuous daughter, Diana, is tormented by her evil cousin, the new queen. Sentenced to a slow and tortuous execution, Ursus breaks free and a revolt breaks out.

Soraya refuses to be the Sheik's girl, and plunges from a tower into the river - where she would have drowned if Anthar would not appear to save her once more. Together they go to Baghdad, where Anthar gets Daykor out of prison. But Ganor captures Anthar, and sets him to fight a rhinoceros to get rid of the freedom fighter. Daykor and Soraya return to Baghdad at the head of the revolted people, and after a siege, they take the city and joining with Anthar, will finally prevail over the tyrant.",

Featuring radical visual touches, full-throttle performances, brilliant cinematography by Stanley Cortez, and one bizarrely beautiful musical number, The Naked Kiss is among Fuller's greatest, boldest entertainments.",

While on Earth, they kidnap two lively children that lead the group of Martians to the North Pole and Santa Claus. The Martians then take Santa Claus and the two children back to Mars with them. Voldar, a particularly grumpy Martian, attempts to do away with the children and Santa Claus before they get to Mars, but their leader Lord Kimar stops him. When they arrive on Mars, Santa Claus, with the help of the two Earth children and a rather simple-minded Martian lackey, overcomes the Martians by bringing fun, happiness and Christmas cheer to the children of Mars.",

    "plot outline": "When a plague devastated life on Earth, the population died or became a sort of zombie living in the dark. Dr. Robert Morgan is the unique healthy survivor on the planet, having a routine life for his own survival: he kills the night creatures along the day and maintains the safety of his house, to be protected along the night. He misses his beloved wife and daughter, consumed by the outbreak, and he fights against his loneliness to maintain mentally sane. When Dr. Morgan finds the contaminated Ruth Collins, he uses his blood to heal her and he becomes the last hope on Earth to help the other contaminated survivors. But the order of this new society is scary.",

In the current day Romania, a newlywed couple gets lost and ends up in the same Transylvanian village where the earlier events occurred. After the hotel owner spies on them making love, they leave town hurriedly. The steering mechanism of their car goes amiss and they plunge into a lake. The groom escapes unharmed, but the bride reappears as the apparently dead body of the witch. The local Count Von Helsing, displaced from his castle into a cave, agrees to help the groom exorcise the witch and bring his wife back. Things get complicated when the local police accuse the groom of murdering his wife. Their case falls apart, however, when Von Helsing steals the body the body the police are holding and wakes it up. Then it is a wild goose chase until the groom and Von Helsing can properly put an end to the witch. As the witch is drowned for good in the lake, the bride floats to the surface gasping for breath.",

Dr. Richard Arden, preeminent in the field of extraterrestrial study, is not permitted to accompany his colleagues, including his girlfriend Lee Mason, because he is still recovering from the effects of a recent motor accident. The scientists are summarily taken over by some alien force, and others in the area are dying from a mysterious \"crimson plague,\" which covers their bodies with drops of blood. Temple seems the only person immune to both maladies, so if he can discover the reason for this immunity, he may yet foil the alien plan to take earthlings back to the moon for their own sinister purposes.",

Without communication, another rocket is launched with Commander Brendan Lockhart, Andre Ferneau and Hans Walter to rescue the first team and explore the planet. They use a vehicle to seek Kern and Sherman, but they are attacked by a flying reptile. They kill the animal without knowing that it is worshiped and considered the God Terah by Venusians women that use their powerful connection with nature to destroy the invaders.

    "plot outline": "In 1870 Texas, a gang of gun smugglers supplies arms, ammunition and whiskey to Indians. Undercover government agent Martin Benson helps the army eliminate such smugglers. However, the army still needs to know the identity of the man in charge of the gang and the location of their latest hideout. Martin Benson wants to retire but the army asks him to find the head of the smugglers. The army arguments that Benson is the best agent for the job even if another undercover agent, Tony Guy, has already penetrated the smugglers' outfit. A huge payment in gold coins is also offered to Benson as an enticement. Benson agrees to this last assignment and heads out of the army fort. On the trail, many gun runners and bandits try to ambush him and have him killed. In the nearest town, at the Benson farm, a group of smugglers raid and ransack the farm and kill Martin Benson's parents. They also rape his sister, Jenny. The other Benson siblings, Arias, Susy and Daniel are in town buying supplies. When they return to the farm, they find their parents dead and sister Jenny in shock and unable to speak. They also find a wounded man in the shed. Jenny seems terrified of him and the siblings assume the wounded man is one of the bandits, possibly the one who raped Jenny. Motivated by revenge, the older brother Daniel, wants to kill the wounded bandit but changes his mind when he realizes that he could extract vital information about the gang from the wounded man. Daniel decides to save the life of the wounded outlaw by all means and force him to reveal the identity of the other gang members. When the sheriff's posse arrives at the farm, the Benson children conceal the fact there is a wounded bandit in their shed. One posse member is local businessman Vic Graham who adores Susan Benson but Susan was never interested in him. After the posse leaves the farm, Daniel sends for the town doctor to come and patch-up the wounded outlaw. When Martin Benson finally arrives in town, he is given the sad news about his family's tragedy. Susan and Daniel take Martin to the local caves where they have relocated the wounded bandit. When Martin Benson comes face to face with the wounded outlaw everyone has a shocking surprise.",

It seems that the law is not welcomed there; every marshall that's been sent has been chased out. But Harmon is a different story, upon arriving, he encounters two drunks and asks them to come with him to cool off, one of them pulls a gun on him and shoots, Harmon with no other choice shoots him. He is told that the man he killed is the brother of Arch King, a powerful man, who adheres to only one law, his. Later that evening someone breaks into the jail and lets the other man out and shoots him with Harmon's gun. It seems that the other man is also King's brother. Most people think that Harmon shot him but a Mexican boy whom Harmon allowed to sleep on the floor of the jail said that it was two men and that one of them's a soldier. Harmon is then visited by King and is told that unless he can prove that he was not the one who killed his brother, King will be back and will deal with him in his own way. Harmon then rides out to the army fort to tell them that one of their soldiers was one of the men who killed his prisoner. It seems that Harmon is not well received by the army, it seems that years ago, his family was killed and he believes that soldiers were involved, so wherever he is assigned, it's always near an army fort or base.",

He and his expedition discover the remnants of the once dominant civilization living on a subsistence level in caves. Long ago their advanced society had become so complacent that they built a super-computer to run and maintain the machines that supported their indolent, self-indulgent lifestyle. After the machines were destroyed by a meteor shower, the inhabitants found themselves without the knowledge to rebuild them, completely subservient to the computer whose megalomania was now unchallenged. The cruel cyber-despot reveals that it arranged for ship's landing because it needs the skills of the Earthlings to make critical repairs in its damaged circuitry. When the computer announces future plans for the conquest of the Universe, the captain and his crew know it is time to act.",

Under pressure to finish his oft-delayed grand masterpiece, his psychotic alter-ego takes over and he begins killing random vagrants to boost his creativity, not quite realizing that it is happening in reality. When an art dealer grimly rejects Reno's finished masterpiece, Reno's mental condition quickly deteriorates.",

    "plot outline": "The princess's fianc\u00e9, King Chi, learns that the emperor's right hand man, Pai Yeh Hu, is plotting an assassination. He attempts to stop it, but ends up accused of the attempted regicide. Worse, he throws a poisoned dart meant for Pai Yeh Hu, but it hits the princess instead. For days she is near death. The emperor decrees that anyone who can save her will win her hand in marriage. King Chi, unable to bring the antidote himself, sends his monkey to do the job. But after the monkey saves the princess's life, the emperor is honor-bound to keep his promise. He marries his daughter to the monkey and then sends them both adrift in a boat, which takes them to a deserted island. Ten years later, the princess has a son. The two are alone on an island with \"Uncle Monkey.\" But the boy's father, King Chi, is hiding on a mountain, improving his kung fu skills in order to exact his revenge.",

Before his master's death, San Mao was taught various styles of acrobatic kung fu and uses these skills to showcase his talents on the street for money. While coming to one such town, he encounters a smart-mouthed little beggar named Qu Pu Li, who currently lives with a teenage orphan girl named Zsa Zsa Meng in the forest. When Qu Pu Li and San Mao meet, they don't exactly see eye to eye. But after a chance encounter with a brutal (but clumsy) man named Ironhead and some local thugs, San Mao and Qu Pu Li decide to put aside their differences and fight to take Ironhead down. Qu Pu Li is thankful for San Mao's help. As a result, he and Zsa Zsa Meng let San Mao stay at their straw home in the forest until San Mao is ready to leave town. While staying with them, Qu Pu Li and Zsa Zsa Meng warn San Mao to watch his step while he is in the village because it is run by Mr. Chu, a vicious man who knows rare styles of kung fu and wants to control the entire province. No one has dared to challenge his power. But all of that changes when a mysterious Korean wanderer named Eagle shows up and helps the three Kung Fu Kids when Ironhead and his thugs try to tear down their \"Stunt Show.\" Later, Eagle assassinates an aid for a local general who works with Mr. Chu to control the village. Eagle is caught in the process and tortured by Mr. Chu's thugs. The Kung Fu Kids decide to repay their debt to Eagle by helping him escape. Together with Chao Chin, Mr. Chu's good-hearted son, the four warriors work on a plan to overthrow Mr. Chu and his syndicate, so that they can restore order and peace to the once uncorrupted village.",

She soon gets the feeling that something is wrong with her room and that it used to be bigger somehow. There she discovers an old wardrobe with a mirror in it. When she sees an image of a young girl in the mirror instead of her own, she begins suffering from violent visions about the young butcher's daughter, who lived there during the 1930s and helped a Jewish dissident hide from Gestapo in the cold room of her father's shop. However, not only was her father a violent staunch Nazi supporter and Party member but he also raped her on nightly basis. Carla slowly loses the ability to separate these horrifying visions from reality and begins to fear her own father. Hugh tries to help her but things only get worse. Is Carla slowly losing her mind or are the visions trying to tell her something?",

The city of Rome is in turmoil. Its tyrant king, Tarquinias, has been overthrown and has fled to nearby Etruria. He begs Porsenna, the king of the Etruscans for help. He needs his army in order to regain power. Porsenna finally agrees and now the newly founded republic of Rome is at war. Tarquinius and the Etruscan army control Rome. Rome is under siege, its people are starving. Legendary heroes come in all shapes and sizes but there is only one Scaevola, \"the iron fist.\"",

Hirliman-produced films starring George O'Brien (preceded by \"Daniel Boone\", \"Park Avenue Logger\" and \"Hollywood Cowboy\") that were distributed by RKO Radio. Hirliman sold O'Brien's contract to RKO, which then produced 18 series westerns starring O'Brien that ended when O'Brien went into the Navy at the outbreak of WW II. Long-time (past and future) O'Brien director David Howard served as Hirliman's Associate Producer on this film. \"Windjammer\" finds O'Brien as a subpoena server ordered to serve a subpoena on Brandon Evans (The Commondore) for a senate inquiry or lose his job. Posing as a playboy, he boards the Commodore's yacht during a yacht race, and the yacht is wrecked by a gun-running windjammer commanded by Captain Morgan (William Hall.) All hands are picked up by the windjammer, including the Commodore's daughter (played by Constance Worth, at her blonde, plumpish best) and put to work as galley slaves and such, but it isn't long before O'Brien starts knocking heads, and making the gun-runners wish they had left him swimming.",

An example of such behavior is performing in or attending burlesque shows, which promote casual sex. Indeed, many in the audience at one burlesque show in New York only have sex on their minds, including young unmarried couple James and Jane, office colleagues Peggy and Betty (Peggy is trying to seduce Betty), and Paul Lorenz's own son Tom, who is anticipating an aftershow group-sex party that will include some of the girls from the show, such as Sheila Wayne, who has syphilis but treats it as casually as her sexual encounters. Her fellow showgirl Millicent Hamilton will not be at the party. Millicent was once a small-town girl who was planning to marry her beau, Wendel Hope, until she won a beauty contest. Her prize was a trip to New York, but life there was more difficult than she expected, and a sexual encounter associated with trying to advance her show-business career resulted in her also contracting syphilis. Respected Dr. Hampton informs her that she can fully recover and eventually marry Wendel if she takes the slow and intensive but proven therapy, but when she leaves New York for home--which means therapy with another doctor--Dr. Hampton warns her to beware of quacks who might promise expensive miracle cures. Will she heed Dr. Hampton's advice, or will she fall prey to the hope of a quick cure so that she can marry Wendel sooner?",

Eric gathers a team of expert fighters from his school and goes off to get the girl back. But emotions run high when the team is joined by the father who had left his family years ago. Later, they'll be joined by a kidnapper with a conscience. In the hills, the girl escapes and gets recaptured several times.

The producers (Max and Arthur Alexander) and Associate Producer (their cousin Alfred Stern)didn't make this on a budget that allowed for rental of ties, tracks and locomotives, so opted for highway construction and having to only rent a Caterpillar tractor for the construction scene. The fictional Gene Austin (played by the real Gene Austin) is the fictional foster son of a fictional rancher and comes to the fictional Sage City to lend a hand against the baddies. Austin (aided by Coco & Candy, whose character names aren't Coco and Candy in the film)plays the piano and sings five songs he wrote---\"Song of the Saddle\"; \"I'm Coming Home\"; \"I Fell Down and Broke My Heart (in Two)\"; \"Why Can't I Be Your Sweetheart, Tonight\" and \"The Man From Texas\"---and they are passable, for fans of Austin's singing style. The trouble comes when Austin takes to the saddle. That isn't a pretty sight.",

But the syndicate doesn't want revenge: it wants these four guys on their side. That way, the syndicate will be invincible. Three of the four robbers think crime is easy; but their leader, Ma Yi, is more level-headed. Before their adventures are over, the robbers will find themselves traveling from Hong Kong to Thailand; enduring the wrath of the double-crossing syndicate; and suffering the brutality of the police. Meanwhile, Ma Yi must keep the others from gambling away all their stolen loot. But his principles, and his loyalty to his brothers in crime, are more important than the ill-gotten gains.",

The One Eyed Soldiers.\" Unaware he has heard the words that are the key to the location of a fabulous hidden treasure, Ferrer returns to his headquarters. The pursuit and death of Berens has been observed by The Fat Man/Harold Schmidt with more than passing interest, and begins a series of chilling events involving many people. One of them is Beren's daughter, Gava, because \"the key\" was meant to be passed to her, and another is American newspaperman Richard Owen, an innocent bystander, who gets caught up in the search and intrigue.",

    "plot outline": "This public service short film is a cautionary tale to adolescent and young teen boys to beware the kindness of older male strangers, some who are mentally ill in that they are homosexuals preying on them. An easy way for these homosexuals to make their move is to pick up unsuspecting hitchhiking youths. Such is the case of young Jimmy Barnes, who, when thumbing for a ride, is picked up by a strange man - \"Ralph\" - who ultimately befriends him, gives him ride after ride, gives him gifts and takes him on outings. It isn't until after Jimmy accepts all these favors that he learns Ralph's true intentions of wanting sexual favors from him in return. Jimmy is lucky in that he ultimately is able to report Ralph to his parents and the authorities. Young Mike Merrick is not as lucky. He is befriended by a stranger at the playground. The stranger ultimately takes him away and kills him. Boys should also beware of strange men who tell what may sound like an emergency situation, such as the strange man who approaches Denny and Jerry in a car saying that some bikes were stolen, and if either would recognize the boys that may have just ridden by. Denny goes off with the man, but is lucky that Jerry stays behind, as when he later learns that Denny never made it home, he is able to tell the authorities the license plate number of the strange man's car. Another popular tactic with the homosexual is to loiter around public restrooms. So boys must be aware of strangers who are too friendly or are hanging around for no seeming reason in places where boys congregate.",

After dinner she proposes that he marry her and he consents, still wondering. She makes him promise that he will never speak of their marriage. They start on their honeymoon. Harland is soon in love with her and tries to solve the \"why\" of it all, but cannot seem to arrive at any solution. One day he sees her talking to a man at a hotel, but she disclaims knowing anyone there. This angers him. He accuses the man of knowing his wife, but he disclaims any knowledge of knowing Harland's wife. The man is the detective who had been in Eleanor's employ. She feigns illness and goes to her room, followed by the now-angry Harland. Then she confesses that she has loved him since the time when as a child he had saved her life during one of his prospecting trips. She tells him she employed the detective to follow him.",
